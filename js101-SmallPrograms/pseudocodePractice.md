For now, try a few practice rounds using pseudocode to guide your problem-solving logic. For example, write out pseudocode (both casual and formal) that does the following:

a function that returns the sum of two numbers

given two numbers
take first number and add it to the second number
store the results of the sum in a variable
return that results of adding both of those numbers

START
given two numbers
SET a variable to store the sum of two numbers
add first number to second number
SET results of that to variable declared earlier
PRINT results
END

a function that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together

a method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element from the original array, starting with the first element. For instance:
